## Task 1 — Project scaffolding & environment

### What Was Built
The empty skeleton of the whole project: every folder it will eventually need
(`etl/`, `warehouse/`, `data_quality/`, `django_app/`, `tests/`, etc.), a pinned
dependency list, a place to store secrets safely, and one file that loads and
validates all configuration. Nothing does real work yet — this is the foundation
everything else sits on.

### Concepts Used
- **Virtual environment (`venv`)**: an isolated Python install just for this
  project, so its package versions can't clash with other projects on the machine.
- **Pinned dependencies**: writing exact versions (`pandas==2.2.3`) in
  `requirements.txt` so the project installs the *same* way on any machine — the
  difference between "works on my laptop" and reproducible.
- **Secrets management / 12-factor config**: keys and passwords live in a `.env`
  file that is *never* committed. `.env.example` is committed instead — it lists
  the variable *names* with dummy values so a new developer knows what to fill in.
- **Fail-fast / fail-loud configuration**: the program refuses to start if a
  required setting is missing, instead of crashing later with a confusing error
  deep in the code.
- **Single source of truth**: all environment values are read in exactly one
  module (`config.py`); nothing else touches `os.environ`. Change a setting once,
  not in ten places.
- **`.gitignore`**: tells git which files to never track (secrets, the venv,
  logs, compiled `.pyc` files).

### Key Code
`config.py` — `_require()` and the fail-loud block:
> `_require()` doesn't raise the moment it finds one missing variable. It appends
> the name to a `_missing` list and keeps going, so after all variables are
> checked we can raise *one* error listing every missing name at once. That means
> you fix all of them in a single pass instead of re-running, hitting the next
> missing var, re-running again. This "collect errors, then report together"
> pattern is common and underused.

`config.py` — `PROJECT_ROOT = Path(__file__).resolve().parent`:
> Paths are derived from where the file actually lives, not hardcoded like
> `/home/vntrxz/Projects/theoria`. The project still works if someone clones it
> into a different folder — a small habit that prevents a whole class of
> "works only on my machine" bugs.

`load_dotenv(PROJECT_ROOT / ".env")`:
> Reads the `.env` file into environment variables at import time. Real OS
> environment variables (e.g. those set in CI) take precedence, which is exactly
> what you want in production where there is no `.env` file at all.

### What to Study Next
Read about the **12-factor app** methodology, specifically factor III, "Config"
(https://12factor.net/config) — it explains *why* config belongs in the
environment and not in code. Then ask: how would this `config.py` behave on a
server that has no `.env` file but sets real environment variables instead?
